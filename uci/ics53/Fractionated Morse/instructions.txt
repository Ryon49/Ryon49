Once the plaintext is converted to morse code, the next step is to remap the morse code using the secret key. To encrypt/decrypt the morse code message a secret key shared between the sender and receiver is required. This key must be a mixed alphabet key, meaning it must contain all 26 capital letters of the alphabet. A random ordering of the alphabet is difficult for anyone to remember, therefore instead we will use a phrase and add any missing alphabet characters.  Any  symbols/punctuation, spaces, non-visible characters and numbers in the phrase are ignored.
