ONCE THE PLAINTEXT IS CONVERTED TO MORSE CODE, THE NEXT STEP IS TO REMAP THE MORSE CODE USING THE SECRET KEY. TO ENCRYPTDECRYPT THE MORSE CODE MESSAGE A SECRET KEY SHARED BETWEEN THE SENDER AND RECEIVER IS REQUIRED. THIS KEY MUST BE A MIXED ALPHABET KEY, MEANING IT MUST CONTAIN ALL 26 CAPITAL LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET.
